## UX

So, what exactly is Ux? Ux places the end user at the center of the universe and defines the system from that vantage point. It is concerned with finding the ideal fit between a user's wants and the usage of a product. Ux designers are responsible for a wide variety of tasks such as user research, design, testing, analytics, communication, and so on.

Even if you are not a Ui/Ux designer, every time you implement a Ui, you must consider what makes sense from the user's perspective. Ux is an indispensable component of every application, and every developer is required to have a basic understanding of it.

### Is it expected that frontend devs master Ui/Ux?

The right response to this question will clearly differ from one company to the next. Larger corporations will most likely have dedicated Ux/Ui designers, whereas startups may demand each employee to do a broader variety of activities. However, in any case, so many of these responsibilities overlap that you simply cannot contribute to the team adequately unless you know what the other people on the team are doing.

## Steps of Ux design

The process of Ux design may be broken down into the following steps:

1. Defining the problem - here we try to understand what the App should do and who are the users.
2. Competitive analysis - there is always competition in the market. Even if the App addresses a niche problem, there will still be comparable products that are already in the market. Our task is to find the existing products that are similar to ours and figure out their strengths and weaknesses.
3. User interviews - every App has a target audience. We need to gather data from users to understand their needs and preferences.
4. Insight and analysis - after gathering data, it is time to analyze it. Could we draw conclusions from the data? Does it confirm our expectations or have we learned something new?
5. Design concepts - we need to come up with a set of ideas that will help us to create the best user experience. We create a mockup of the App and we start to sketch out the design.
6. Testing and improvements - we test the first design with the users. We then iterate on the design and make appropriate improvements.
7. Final design - we finalize the design and make it ready for implementation.
8. Design systems - optionally we can prepare a design system to make the implementation easier for the developers. Design systems include icons, colors, typography, and other assets that are used in the App.

## Identifying the target audience

There is always a target audience. No App can be built for everyone. We need to understand the target audience to understand the needs of the App.

### Ethnographics

It is important to not include any features that might be inappropriate for a certain demographic. Example questions we might want to answer:
- What is the age group of the target audience?
- Is there a gender preference?
- Is it restricted to a geographical area?

### Technical skill level

Deciding factor whether the design should emphasize ease of use and learning or efficiency. Simple three levels of skills:
- Noob
- Experienced user
- Power user

### Knowledge

We want to know what external information users must have to accomplish their tasks. In the most basic scenario, there are two choices:
- No experience
- Domain experience

### Environment

Where will the App be used? Is it something a laboratory technician will use, or is it targeted to a home user? Some ways to describe the environment are:
- Noisy vs quiet
- Light vs dark

## How to conduct user interviews?

User interviews are classified into two types:
1. The one carried out throughout the design process's research phase.
1. The one performed when a ready interface is tested.

You want the following in both cases:

1. Determine the target user base ahead of time.
1. Plan topics ahead of time. You may also provide a piece of paper with prepared questions and possible answers. 

During the testing phase, you want to:

1. Assign a task to users to complete against your interface and monitor their behavior.
1. Encourage them to think aloud about what they are seeing, what they are attempting to achieve, and what they think about the activities they are taking.
1. Note down any remarks
1. Never lead the user. Allow them to do the task until they succeed or give up. Struggles might indicate that information is not well arranged or that something is missing.
1. Analyze the results and make recommendations.

## What to avoid?

1. Complicating access to functionality:
    - Excessive number of clicks/taps required to access functionality.
    - Overlapping or hidden UI elements.
    - Multiple nested menus.
    - Too many actions on a single screen.
    - Overloading buttons or controls with multiple functions.

2. Unprofessional writing:
    - Inconsistent terminology, labeling or wording.
    - Unclear, vague or ambiguous messages.
    - Negative or unfriendly language.
    - Poor grammar, spelling or punctuation.
    - Using overly technical or industry-specific jargon.

3. Misleading titles and labels:
    - Labels that don't accurately describe the content or function.
    - Misleading titles that don't match the expected behavior.
    - Using icons or symbols that are unclear or have multiple interpretations.

4. Unconventional application windows:
    - Non-standard window layouts or navigation.
    - Unusual control placement or behavior.
    - Inconsistent styling or theming.

5. Misusing choice controls and tabs:
    - Using checkboxes for mutually exclusive options.
    - Using radio buttons for non-exclusive options.
    - Providing too many or too few options.
    - Using tabs for unrelated content.
    - Using tabs for complex or nested options.

6. Providing faulty feedback:
    - Not providing feedback or confirmation for actions.
    - Providing unclear or ambiguous feedback.
    - Providing redundant or unnecessary feedback.
    - Providing feedback after a significant delay.

7. Abusing text fields:
    - Using text fields for non-editable content.
    - Not providing proper validation or formatting for input.
    - Allowing input that is too long or too short.
    - Not providing proper feedback or error messages.

8. Abusing dialog boxes:
    - Overusing or misusing dialog boxes.
    - Providing too many or too few options.
    - Using unclear or ambiguous language.
    - Not providing proper feedback or confirmation.
    
## Design principles

There are a couple of design principles that can help us to create a good user experience.

### The Structure Principle

- The structure of the App should be simple and well organized.
- The tasks should be apparent and easy to accomplish.
- Information should be grouped in logical units and separated as much as possible.
- Users tasks shouldn't be complicated.
- Unexpected behaviour should be avoided.

### The Visibility Principle

- The main tasks should be easily accessible.
- It should be clear how to go from one activity to another.
- If some options are not shown, there should be a clear indication where they are located.
- There should be no unnecessary information shown.

Examples:
- Change cursor to indicate action.
- Highlights to show selected objects.
- Status bar to show progress.

### The Feedback Principle

- Every action should have a visual feedback.
- Changes of state should be should be shown in a clear way.
- Errors and exceptions shouldn't be swallowed and should be clearly indicated with concise and unambiguous messages.
- Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.

Examples:
- Message box to ask for confirmation before error-prone actions.

### The Tolerance Principle

- It is unavoidable that users will make mistakes so every action should be recoverable.
- The App should  give the users some reasonable recommendations, to help them to make the right choice.
- All possibile inputs should be taken into account, especially variations in spelling, puncutuation and capitalization.
button
- Long operations should be allowed to be paused/suspended.

Examples:
- Undo and redo buttons.
- Cancel button in a dialog.

### The Consistency Principle

- Define the conventions and adhere to them throughout the app.
- Use the same elements, layouts, actions, and behavior across all Ui components.
- Avoid using different  words to explain the same thing.
  
### Gestalt Principles

The Gestalt Principles are a set of laws that describe how humans perceive and organize visual information. These principles include:

- Proximity: Elements that are close together are perceived as a group.
- Similarity: Elements that look similar are perceived as a group.
- Closure: The brain tends to fill in missing information to create a complete picture.
- Continuity: The eye is drawn to continuous lines and curves.
- Figure-Ground: The brain separates visual information into a foreground and a background.

Designers can use these principles to create designs that are visually appealing and easy to understand.
    
## Interesting Observations

### Hick's Law

Hick's Law is a principle stating that the number of options given to a person influences how long it takes them to make a decision. More choices will increase the time it takes to make a decision logarithmically. In order to reduce decision time and improve user experience, it's important to limit the number of options and provide a clear hierarchy of information.

### Golden Ratio

The Golden Ratio is a fundamental mathematical ratio that some say is the most visually beautiful pattern to the human eye. The ratio is around 1.618 and is commonly found in nature and art. Designers can use this ratio to create a sense of balance and harmony in their designs, such as in the proportions of typography, images, and layouts.

### 80/20 Rule

According to the 80/20 rule, about 80% of the consequences result from 20% of the causes. It could be the case that just 20% of a product's features are used by 80% of its users. Therefore, it's important for designers to focus on the features that are most important to users and to prioritize them in the design.

### F-Pattern

The F-Pattern is an observation about how users examine user interfaces. Humans read a UI interface in an F-shaped pattern with two horizontal stripes and one vertical stripe. This means that users are more likely to focus on the top and left-hand side of the screen, so designers should place important information and calls-to-action in these areas.

### 60-30-10 Rule

The 60-30-10 rule might be used to create a color scheme. The general guideline is to use three colors: one for 60% of the space, another for 30%, and a third for the remaining 10%. This can help to create a balanced and harmonious color scheme that is visually appealing and easy on the eyes.
