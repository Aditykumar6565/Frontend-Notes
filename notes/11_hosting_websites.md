## Hosting
 
So your website is ready, but it still sits locally on your PC? Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet can access your website.

## Get your own domain name
 
A domain name is the name of a website entered into an address bar (like google.com). The idea behind a domain name is to save visitors from having to memorize your IP address in order to visit your website. There are firms that are authorized to reserve a domain name on your behalf.

To retain a domain name registered, a minor yearly fee is normally required (around 10 euro). You own a domain as long as you pay the annual fee, but you may also sell it to someone for whatever price you desire. Domain names do not include your data or your website; instead, you add "DNS settings" that lead visitors to your domain to your IP address.

Popular options to buy a domain:
* <a href="https://www.domain.com/">domain</a>

* <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a>

Whatever option you select, you should be able to upload the files that comprise your website to the server. If you used a public Git repository for your project, uploading the files should be as simple as copying the repository URL. That solution has one extra advantage: if you update your repository, your website is immediately updated.
 
## Connect your domain to the server.

1. Determine your server's IP address (should be available from the sidebar or navigation bar on the hosting provider website).
2. Go to the website where you purchased your domain and sign in.
3. Add your server's IP address to the DNS records on your domain website.
4. After a few minutes, test it out.

## Your own server
Although it is not suggested for commercial projects, you can host a website on your own server for educational purposes. To build a server, you may use an old PC or even a Raspberry Pi.
