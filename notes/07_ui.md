## Purpose
Ui is huge. In fact some people dedicate their whole carees to it. We do only technical side here.
Even if there is someone other than you assign to it, if you do anything with frontend you do ui as well. You are the first user.

Ui and frontend go hand in hand. Theses days some companies have dedicated Ui/UX designer but a lot of small shops can't really afford them and their responsibilties are taken by frontend developers. But even if the frontend developer is just handed the ready mockups it still helps to understand the ui perspecitve. To think about spacing, colors, layouts, borders and so on.

## Terminology

Let's first make sure we are on the same page when it comes to terminology.

### User Experience (Ux)
Ux places the end user at the center of the universe and defines the system from that vantage point. It is concerned with finding the ideal fit between a user's wants and the usage of a product. 

### User Interface (Ui)
All viusal components of the App.

### User Flow
All actions taken by the user to complete a task. 

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A product with only the functionality required to suit the demands of early consumers. It provides crucial feedback to designers and the product team on how to further enhance the product. 

### Call To Action (CTA)
The phrase and design element that motivates people to interact with a product in the intended manner.

## Ui components

So when should we use which Ui component?

### Buttons
Use buttons to perform discrete, separate actions relevant to the current screen.
* Instead of using generic button text, try using verb phrases like "Save" or "Cancel".
* Use mnemonics such as "OK," "Yes," and "No" for example.

### Text
Show text when there is read only information to be displayed.

### Inputs
Use inputs when the user may enter a number, a date, a time, or a phone number.

### Lists
Use lists when the user can select many items.

### Radio Buttons
When just one option may be selected at a time, use radio buttons.

### Comboboxes
When there are a lot of fixed options, use combo boxes instead of presenting them all at once.

### Checkboxes
Use check boxes for independent on/off switches

### Menus
Use menus for rare activities that may apply to more than one view.

* Users despise menus! Avoid relying too heavily on menus.

### Dialogs
To offer temporary screens or options, utilize dialog boxes.
* Modal dialogs are used when the user must complete a task before continuing.

### Toolbars
• Use toolbars for common actions.

### Tooltips
Use tooltips for short descriptions of controls that doesn't have to be shown all the time.

### Sliders
For numeric input, use sliders or spinners.

## Types of Ui design
Before you come up with polished final version of the Ui, you need to create a scaled-down, incomplete version for the purposes of demonstaration and testing. Wireframes, mockups, and prototypes are distinctive deliverables used at different stages of a product’s design process.

1. Wireframe - rough sketch of the Ui
2. Prototype - detailed sketch of the Ui
3. Mockup - a high-fidelity mockup of the Ui

Reasons for dividing the design process into three phases:
* help discover requirements
* help discover test cases and provide a basis for testing
* allows interaction with user and customer to ensure satisfaction

For the frist two stages, you have two options to approach them:

* digitally
* on paper

## Ui sketching

###  Advantages
1. Quick way to prepare a wireframe/prototype.
2. Helps to get a feel for the Ui.
3. Numerous issues are immediately identified.
4. Allows for testing and presentation of the ideas.
5. Other team members can participate in the process (doesn't require any technical knowledge).

### Disadvantages
1. No code is written.
2. Some issues may only be seen in the real application.
3. The Ui is not polished.

### Representation of different components

| Component | Representation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Buttons, check boxes | tape |
| Tabs, dialog boxes | index cards |
| Text fields | removable tape |
| Combo boxes | put the choices on a separate piece of paper |
| Selections | a highlighted piece of tape or transparency |
| Disabled widgets | make a gray version that can sit on top of the normal enabled version |

## Ui Kits

Allow you to use premade and predesigned components in your app. Usually work wiht one or more Js framework. Popular choices nowadays include:

* Ant Design
* Material Ui
* Chakra Ui
* Bootstrap
* Semantic Ui

## Tools

There are numerous tools that Ui designers use to create and design interfaces.

* Sketching and User Flows
        - InVision
        - Whimsical
        - OmniGraffle Pro

* Wireframing
        - Balsamiq
        - Justinmind
        - UXPin

* Interface Design and Prototyping
        - Figma
        - Sketch
        - Adobe XD

## Rules of thumb

* Radio Buttons and Checkboxes shouldn't be used together <a href="https://uxmovement.com/forms/why-radio-buttons-and-checkboxes-cant-co-exist/">Source</a>.
