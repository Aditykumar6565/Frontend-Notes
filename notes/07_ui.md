## UI

UI (user interface) and frontend development go hand in hand. Even if there is someone other than you assigned to it, if you work with the frontend, you are the first user. This note provides an introduction to UI terminology, components, design types, and tools.

## Terminology

It's essential to understand the following terminology:

### User Experience (UX)

UX design puts the end user at the center of the universe and defines the system from that vantage point. It is concerned with finding the ideal fit between a user's wants and the usage of a product.

### User Interface (UI)

UI comprises all visual components of an app.

### User Flow

User flow includes all actions taken by the user to complete a task.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

An MVP is a product with only the functionality required to suit the demands of early consumers. It provides crucial feedback to designers and the product team on how to further enhance the product.

### Call To Action (CTA)

CTA is the phrase and design element that motivates people to interact with a product in the intended manner.

## UI Components

When should we use which UI component?

### Buttons

Use buttons to perform discrete, separate actions relevant to the current screen.
* Try using verb phrases like "Save" or "Cancel" instead of using generic button text.
* Use mnemonics such as "OK," "Yes," and "No" for example.

### Text

Show text when there is read-only information to be displayed.

### Inputs

Use inputs when the user may enter a number, a date, a time, or a phone number.

### Lists

Use lists when the user can select many items.

### Radio Buttons

When just one option may be selected at a time, use radio buttons.

### Comboboxes

When there are many fixed options, use combo boxes instead of presenting them all at once.

### Checkboxes

Use check boxes for independent on/off switches.

### Menus

Use menus for rare activities that may apply to more than one view.

* Avoid relying too heavily on menus because users often despise them.

### Dialogs

To offer temporary screens or options, utilize dialog boxes.
* Use modal dialogs when the user must complete a task before continuing.

### Toolbars

Use toolbars for common actions.

### Tooltips

Use tooltips for short descriptions of controls that don't have to be shown all the time.

### Sliders

For numeric input, use sliders or spinners.

## Types of UI Design

Before you come up with a polished final version of the UI, you need to create a scaled-down, incomplete version for the purposes of demonstration and testing. Wireframes, mockups, and prototypes are distinctive deliverables used at different stages of a productâ€™s design process.

1. Wireframe - rough sketch of the UI
2. Prototype - detailed sketch of the UI
3. Mockup - a high-fidelity mockup of the UI

Reasons for dividing the design process into three phases:
* Help discover requirements
* Help discover test cases and provide a basis for testing
* Allow interaction with users and customers to ensure satisfaction

For the first two stages, you have two options to approach them:

* Digitally
* On paper

## UI Sketching

### Advantages

1. Quick way to prepare a wireframe/prototype.
2. Helps to get a feel for the UI.
3. Numerous issues are immediately identified.
4. Allows for testing and presentation of ideas.
5. Other team members can participate in the process (doesn't require any technical knowledge).

### Disadvantages

1. No code is written.
2. Some issues may only be seen in the real application.

## Ui Kits

Ui kits are pre-designed and pre-made collections of components that can be used to build an application's user interface. Ui kits usually work with one or more JavaScript frameworks and can save developers a significant amount of time by providing ready-made components that can be easily integrated into an application. Some popular Ui kits include:

* Ant Design
* Material Ui
* Chakra Ui
* Bootstrap
* Semantic Ui

## Tools

There are a variety of tools available for designing and prototyping user interfaces. Here are some commonly used ones:

### Sketching and User Flows
* InVision
* Whimsical
* OmniGraffle Pro

### Wireframing
* Balsamiq
* Justinmind
* UXPin

### Interface Design and Prototyping
* Figma
* Sketch
* Adobe XD

When selecting a tool, it's important to consider the features and capabilities required for the project, as well as the budget and familiarity with the tool. It may be beneficial to experiment with several tools to find the one that best fits the project's needs.

## Rules of Thumb

Here are a few general rules of thumb to keep in mind when designing user interfaces:

* Radio buttons and checkboxes shouldn't be used together.
* Avoid relying too heavily on menus.
* Use verb phrases for button text, such as "Save" or "Cancel".
* Use mnemonics like "OK", "Yes", and "No".
* Use tooltips for short descriptions of controls that don't need to be shown all the time.
