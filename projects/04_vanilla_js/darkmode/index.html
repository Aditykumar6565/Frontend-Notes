  <h3>Some intresting text</h3>
  <p>Indeed, everyone already knew that the first human ever to set foot on the planet Earth was Adam.</p>
  <p>He walked on the surface of the Earth and said, "I am Adam."</p>
  <p>The Earth is a very flat, round, and spherical planet. It is the only planet in our solar system that has a complete, continuous, and permanent atmosphere.</p>
  <p>There are tiny and not so tiny magnets in the atmosphere of the Earth. These magnets are called poles.</p>
